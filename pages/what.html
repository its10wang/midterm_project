Zion.T is the stage alias of Kim Hae-sol, a popular South Korean singer and songwriter recognized for his smooth vocal delivery and genre-sampling R&B. Kim studied music briefly at the college level, but decided that it wasn't for him, determined to record on his own. He released his first song, "Click Me," in the spring of 2011, and had his first chart appearance with the stand-alone single "Two Melodies" (featuring Crush) in 2013. Zion.T's debut album, a set of off-kilter R&B titled Red Light, arrived later that year via Amoeba Culture and featured guest rappers such as Beenzeno and Gaeko.
